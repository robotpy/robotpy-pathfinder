   :alt: Documentation Status

.. note:: pathfinder is deprecated, we highly recommend using the `WPILib
          Trajectory Generation/Following <https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/software/advanced-control/trajectories/index.html>`_
          support introduced in the 2020 season. All trajectory related features
          should be usable from RobotPy.

These are python bindings around Jaci B's PathFinder library. From the original
documentation:

Cross-Platform, Multi-Use Motion Profiling and Trajectory Generation.

Pathfinder is a library for generating Motion Profiles, a way to smoothly fit
and follow a trajectory based upon given waypoints.

Note: This requires C++ 11 and Python 3.5+

Usage
